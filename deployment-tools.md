# Deployment Tools

Publishing a project means moving assets off your laptop and into reliable environments. This module maps the tooling that packages content, automates delivery, and keeps services reachable for collaborators and users.

You'll cover:

- **Content preparation** by compressing images and authoring Markdown so sites load fast and stay readable.
- **Hosting options** from static GitHub Pages sites and Google Colab notebooks to Vercel serverless functions, Docker and Podman containers, and GitHub Codespaces devcontainers.
- **Automation and connectivity** using GitHub Actions CI/CD, secure ngrok tunnels, and REST APIs with correct CORS handling.
- **Production fundamentals** including FastAPI backends, Google Auth integration, and local LLM endpoints with Ollama.

Together these tools let you launch prototypes quickly, iterate safely, and graduate data products into production-grade deployments.
