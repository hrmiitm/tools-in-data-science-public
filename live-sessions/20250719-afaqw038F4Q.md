Here is the FAQ transcription from the provided audio:

**Q1: There's a lot of background noise. Also, can we retry the screen share for the solution?**

**A1:** Yes, this recording will be available. I've shared a link in the chat for the last month's survey. Do you want to try it out first, or shall I just start explaining? Please let me know if there's any background noise.

**Q2: I couldn't solve the JSON question (Question 3) in the previous mock. Can you help with that?**

**A2:** The first question requires you to write a FastAPI server that takes a URL and returns its header. I've shared the code for this in the chat. My suggestion is to first try it yourself by copying the code into ChatGPT and letting it explain it. This approach often works well.

**Q3: For these assignments, are you using Copilot for code completion?**

**A3:** Yes, I am using Copilot for code completion.

**Q4: I'm not able to submit the URLs in the link you've given. How do I do that?**

**A4:** For every question, there's a 'check' button. If you inspect the element for this button, you'll find a 'disabled' parameter. Just enable that parameter. This assignment's deadline was March 2, 2025, which was from the last term's RO (Rank Order), so it's not accessible directly. Enabling the disabled parameter for the button in the HTML will allow you to submit.

**Q5: How should I approach solving these questions given the limited time? Should I give the question to Copilot and have it generate the code?**

**A5:** Yes, that's what I did today for most questions. Copilot was able to answer many of them, except for maybe the fourth and second questions, which required a bit more prompting. For LLM embeddings, it's just asking for some JSON, which is a very easy question. Focus on the easy questions first. Some questions, like Question 5, might be directly from a previous GA (Graded Assignment) like GA5 or GA4. If you know the concepts, you can solve these quickly.

**Q6: Can you share a notebook with answers to all the GAs?**

**A6:** No, I don't share the answers directly.

**Q7: My answers are not showing up either. Are the answers specific to each student?**

**A7:** Yes, the answers are different for every student. The scripts are meant to help you generate your own solutions. For example, for "four relation calculation," it's just one line of code in Pandas. Identify these easy questions, solve them first, and then move on to the more complex ones.

**Q8: What tools should I have installed as a prerequisite for the examination, besides VS Code?**

**A8:** I recommend having Copilot ready. It will greatly assist you as it understands the context of your files. For example, if you download a zip file with CSVs for a question, you can provide those CSVs to ChatGPT, and it will help you generate the code.

**Q9: Do we need a Linux terminal?**

**A9:** Linux is much faster, and I recommend using it. Copilot often generates code that runs best on Linux. If you're on Windows, you might need to make some adjustments.

**Q10: Is Docker required for RO?**

**A10:** Docker is not required for RO. It's very resource-heavy for this type of assessment.

**Q11: The server needs to be running throughout the examination, right?**

**A11:** Yes, that's correct. You'll be clicking the 'save' button multiple times, and the server needs to be up every time. If RO has multiple questions that require a running server, you should keep the server alive in VS Code throughout the examination.

**Q12: I'm still stuck on Question 4. Can you provide the solution?**

**A12:** I'm trying to go through the easier questions first. I will do them and then move on to the more difficult ones, including Question 4.

**Q13: My code for the JSON question is showing "fail to fetch." What could be the issue?**

**A13:** That "fail to fetch" error usually means your application doesn't have CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled. Always remember to ask Copilot to add CORS to any API that needs to be created. Without it, you'll encounter that error. When generating code for FastAPI, include "add cores to any API" in your prompt. Also, Uvicorn is faster, so I always used to specify Uvicorn in my base prompts.

**Q14: I noticed that content from the server often comes in a variable called `content`. Is that where the response is stored?**

**A14:** Yes, whether using HTTPX or standard requests, the actual response content is typically stored in a variable named `content`.

**Q15: How can I debug this in the exam? I think using Copilot and debugging it in the exam will be difficult.**

**A15:** I agree. In the exam, I wouldn't spend too much time debugging. I'd try to use Copilot strategically. If it gives me a correct answer quickly, I'll use it. For data-related questions, I'd give Copilot a try.

**Q16: How many questions can we expect in the exam?**

**A16:** I don't have information on the exact number of questions for this RO. I will find out on the day of the exam, just like you. The professor decides the RO structure.

**Q17: Which tool do you recommend between ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Copilot?**

**A17:** Copilot is better.

**Q18: You mentioned earlier that we could "hack" the answers to some questions. Can you show how to do that?**

**A18:** I don't know much about "hacking." However, when Copilot gets stuck and can't generate the correct answers, what I used to do was go to the browser's developer tools (Sources tab), copy the relevant code snippet for that particular question (not the entire page), paste it into Copilot, and then ask it to provide the solution. Sometimes it worked better than just giving it the question prompt. It might work in one or two attempts.

**Q19: I'm unable to see the inspect option on my question page in the portal. How can I enable it?**

**A19:** You can open your browser's developer tools (usually by right-clicking and selecting 'Inspect' or pressing F12). Then navigate to the HTML elements. You'll likely find a 'disabled' tag on the button or div element related to the submission. Double-click the 'disabled' attribute, delete it, and press Enter. This should enable the button, allowing you to submit your answer.

**Q20: For question 8, the files are being moved to the same location, which is causing an error. What's wrong?**

**A20:** The issue is that the zip file already contains all the files in the root directory, not in a subdirectory. When the script tries to move files from the extracted folder to the same location, it causes an error because it's trying to move files to a folder that already contains them, leading to a file name conflict. You just need to ensure that the files are not being moved to the exact same location if they already exist there.

**Q21: For Question 9, I'm getting a "Haversine cannot be imported" error. How do I fix this?**

**A21:** The error "Haversine cannot be imported" means that the `haversine` function is not available in the context where you're trying to import it. You need to ensure the correct module is imported. The script needs to use `haversine` to calculate the distance. Make sure `from haversine import haversine` is correctly used after installing the `haversine` library (e.g., `pip install haversine`).

**Q22: Which question are you solving currently?**

**A22:** I'm currently solving Question 9.

**Q23: Are you able to solve Question 12?**

**A23:** No, I'm not able to solve Question 12. It's not directly inside the zip file itself. I'm currently solving Question 10. For Question 10, the prompt mentions that it contains two sets of data: `customer.csv` and `transactions.csv`. It requires joining these two tables and calculating the total revenue for each customer. It's a fairly straightforward join and aggregation task.

**Q24: For Question 5, what should be the approach?**

**A24:** For Question 5, I will have to provide the context of the data structure (the header in the table). Then, I'll just explain what the PDF contains, and I'll copy/paste the question itself. I'll ask it to solve it. Since it's about a PDF, I'll need to give it the context of the PDF structure.

**Q25: I'm facing an issue with Question 6. I copied the code you provided, but it's not giving the correct answer. I'm getting the same incorrect output even after making some changes. What's wrong?**

**A25:** That could be because of incorrect date formats or mismatched columns. The script should ensure that the dates are parsed correctly. If the script isn't handling date conversions properly, it might lead to incorrect calculations. Make sure the 'date' column is correctly converted to datetime objects before performing any operations.

**Q26: For Question 5, can you explain what is involved?**

**A26:** For Question 5, I will explain the data structure, provide the prompt from the question, and ask Copilot to generate the answer. The question involves working with a PDF, so giving context about the PDF structure helps.

**Q27: How can I change the email address in the provided script?**

**A27:** You can change your email address within the script. The script is designed to be customizable for different users.

**Q28: Is Question 8 giving a correct output?**

**A28:** Question 8 is giving the correct output.

**Q29: Are you able to solve Question 9?**

**A29:** Question 9 seems to be working correctly. I'm just running the script with the provided zip file.

**Q30: I'm having trouble with Question 6. The prompt is not giving the correct answer. It is giving the same output. What could be the issue?**

**A30:** I suspect it might be a caching issue with Copilot or an issue with how the data is being reloaded. Sometimes, giving new prompts or slight variations can help.

**Q31: The script I downloaded for Question 6 is not giving the correct output. What could be wrong?**

**A31:** The script actually generates the correct answer. Make sure you are using the correct data set. I'll paste the correct one. The answer is correct, but the issue might be with the data set you're using. I will have to replace the data set in the script with the correct one. It's crucial to use the exact data set specified in the question for the script to work correctly.

**Q32: Are you passing the parameters from the terminal for running the script?**

**A32:** Yes. You would need to pass the parameters from the terminal for running the script. By default, it might be using some other parameters, but you would need to pass those parameters as well. I've given the command for how to run it. If you're encountering an error, it might be because the parameters are not being passed correctly.

**Q33: Can you pass the current version of the script?**

**A33:** Yes, I will. I've given the command to run it. You just need to download your zip file and then pass the parameters while running the script. The script should be designed to take parameters for flexibility.

**Q34: How do I pass the parameters when running the script using Python?**

**A34:** If you are using Python, you would run it like: `python your_script_name.py R_value D_value`. Just replace `R_value` and `D_value` with your actual parameter values.

**Q35: Is there any way to collaborate with others on these assignments using GitHub?**

**A35:** Yes, you can collaborate using GitHub. Create a public repository and invite collaborators. This allows multiple people to push changes to the same repository. If you add someone as a collaborator, they'll be able to push directly to your repo, facilitating teamwork. This is a very efficient way to work on assignments together.

**Q36: Can you elaborate on the collaboration process?**

**A36:** If you want to collaborate, you would add all the collaborators to your GitHub repository. This means if you create a repo, you'd invite others to contribute. They would then be able to push directly to your repository. This reduces the effort of creating pull requests and merging, as everyone can directly commit changes. It makes the process much smoother.

**Q37: What if I prefer using Google Docs to share my code?**

**A37:** That also works.

**Q38: Can you repeat the command for executing the script?**

**A38:** The command is `python your_script_name.py R_value D_value`.

**Q39: How should I handle file structures within the script? Should it assume a specific structure, or should it be generic?**

**A39:** The script should be generic. It should not assume a specific file structure. You should design it so that it can handle different file paths. This makes it more adaptable to various environments and collaborators.

**Q40: For Question 5, what's the issue?**

**A40:** For Question 5, I need to provide the context of the data structure from the PDF file. I will then copy the question and provide it to Copilot, asking it to generate the code based on the PDF context.

**Q41: I'm facing an error that Haversine cannot be imported. What should I do?**

**A41:** The error "Haversine cannot be imported" typically means that the `haversine` library is not installed or not correctly imported. Ensure you have installed the `haversine` library using `pip install haversine` and that your script correctly imports it (e.g., `from haversine import haversine`).

**Q42: Which question are you solving right now?**

**A42:** I am solving Question 9 right now.

**Q43: For Question 10, what's the approach?**

**A43:** Question 10 requires joining `customer.csv` and `transactions.csv` to calculate the total revenue per customer. It's a straightforward join and aggregation task.

**Q44: What's the approach for Question 5?**

**A44:** For Question 5, I will extract the data structure from the PDF using a tool like Tabula, provide that context to Copilot, and then ask it to generate the code for the question.

**A45:** I am working on Question 10.

**Q46: For Question 12, what's the issue?**

**A46:** Question 12's solution is not directly inside the zip file. I'm currently working on Question 10.

**Q47: Are you passing the parameters from the terminal for running the script?**

**A47:** Yes, you need to pass the parameters from the terminal when running the script. For example, `python script.py R_value D_value`. The values for `R` and `D` should be passed as arguments.

**Q48: How do I pass the parameters using Python?**

**A48:** To pass parameters in Python, you'd run your script like `python your_script.py R_value D_value`.

**Q49: How do I collaborate on these assignments using GitHub?**

**A49:** To collaborate, create a public GitHub repository and add your team members as collaborators. This allows everyone to push changes directly. You would share your code through this repository.
