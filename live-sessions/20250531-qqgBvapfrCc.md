Duration: 5440.0Here's an FAQ based on the live tutorial transcript:

**Q1: I'm repeatedly getting "Open API key expired" or similar errors, even after trying both AI Pipe and AI Proxy methods. It worked the first time, but not anymore.**

**A1:** This issue was covered in detail during the Week 3, Session 1 live tutorial on May 24th. You can find the recording on YouTube, and it includes specific timestamps. The key is to ensure you've correctly set up your API tokens in the environment settings and replaced the URL and token accordingly. If you're still facing issues after reviewing the tutorial and trying the suggested steps, please raise a specific question in our Discord channel or during a live session, detailing the exact error message. While it's frustrating, troubleshooting these steps is a crucial part of building your coding background.

**Q2: What's the difference between AI Pipe and AI Proxy, and how do I know which one to use?**

**A2:** Both AI Pipe and AI Proxy serve the same fundamental purpose: to interact with OpenAI models. The main differences lie in the specific models they support and their deployment methods. AI Proxy was used in previous terms. Essentially, instead of directly using an OpenAI API token, these methods act as intermediaries. You can use either; the choice often depends on the specific model version you're working with. Both serve to bypass direct interaction with OpenAI.

**Q3: My GA2 Google Authentication question worked once, but now it's showing errors, specifically a "key error." I've tried recreating it multiple times.**

**A3:** This common troubleshooting scenario for GA2's Google Authentication, including handling API keys and proxies, was thoroughly explained in the Week 3, Session 1 live tutorial on May 24th. Please refer to that session for detailed guidance. If the issue persists, it could be related to specific environment settings or needing multiple services running concurrently (as some students have experienced). It's crucial to identify the exact error message.

**Q4: When will Project 1 be discussed, and what are the mandatory steps to prepare for it?**

**A4:** Project 1 details and preparation steps will be covered in dedicated "breakthrough sessions" starting this weekend, following the completion of GA3. These sessions will guide you through the process, including deploying an application with a public URL. There are no specific restrictions on the deployment tools you use (e.g., Olama, online GPT, API, AWS Mechanical Turk). The timeline for Project 1 will be clearly laid out in those sessions.

**Q5: The TDSC course only lists MLF as a prerequisite, but I feel it requires a strong coding background. What are the true expectations, and how will I manage if I'm not a coding expert?**

**A5:** The GA1 assessment is designed to help you self-evaluate your readiness for the course. While TDSC is coding-heavy, the prerequisite doesn't demand you be a coding expert beforehand. The course is structured to help you develop these skills. The expectation is that you can follow along, use code effectively, and actively engage with the learning resources. We provide extensive learning sessions throughout the course, and you're strongly encouraged to participate and ask questions. Don't hesitate to use Discord for specific problems.

**Q6: In GA3, Question 3, the submission checkbox is missing.**

**A6:** This can often be resolved by using your browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome Dev Tools). This technique was covered in a previous session, specifically on "Development Tools Browser Dev Tools CSS Selectors." You'll need to explore how to enable or interact with the missing element using these tools.

**Q7: I struggled with the GA2 image compression question (reducing to 400KB). I managed it with external tools but couldn't get a precise result using Python libraries. Is there a specific method for this?**

**A7:** There isn't just one "proper" way to handle image compression; multiple methods and libraries exist (e.g., `Pillow`, `Scikit-image`). This is a common challenge, and sometimes achieving the exact size can be tricky. We will cover this in upcoming learning sessions. In the meantime, feel free to raise specific questions with your code in Discord or during a live session if you're stuck on a particular library or approach. It's a prompt engineering question, not purely coding, and often requires creative problem-solving.

**Q8: What is the deadline for Project 1?**

**A8:** The current deadline for Project 1 is June 14th (Saturday).

**Q9: Will there be any breaks for the Paradox course, or will it run continuously?**

**A9:** At this point, there are no planned breaks. The course structure indicates continuous learning. The initial weeks are designed to be heavily loaded with new concepts and tools. Later sections, like data sourcing and analysis, will likely feel lighter as you become more familiar with the tools and apply existing concepts.

**Q10: I find the course content overwhelming, especially with many tools introduced in a short period. I'm struggling with basic concepts like installation and commands. How can I get more in-depth support, particularly for complex topics like Ngrok?**

**A10:** We understand that learning many tools and concepts can be challenging, especially for those new to coding. The course is designed with short, focused videos to maintain engagement, and longer, in-depth discussions happen in live learning sessions.
