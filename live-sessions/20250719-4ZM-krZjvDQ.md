Here is an FAQ summary of the Tools in Data Science (TDS) live tutorial:

---

**Q1: Will there be additional support for Project 2?**

**A1:** Yes, Professor Anand will host two dedicated sessions for Project 2, likely on a Monday and Wednesday from 6 PM to 8 PM. An official email with the finalized dates and times will be sent out, but these sessions are definitely happening next week to help you with any roadblocks, questions, or further guidance you might need.

**Q2: My calendar shows TDS sessions for ROE on Thursday and Friday from 8 PM to 10 PM. Is this correct?**

**A2:** Yes, that's correct. There are two 2-hour sessions tomorrow (Thursday) and Friday from 8 PM to 10 PM. These will be handled by Instructor Jibraj. They'll primarily be a recap of ROE topics already covered and an opportunity for you to bring any specific doubts or questions you might have.

**Q3: Can you explain the general structure and difficulty progression of the course?**

**A3:** The initial phase, particularly the first two weeks, involves the "heavy lifting"—understanding the tools, getting hands-on, debugging, and grasping how things work. After this foundational period, the focus shifts more to handling data and producing results using the tools. Later sessions, which we call "knowledge sessions," are designed to help you manage ROE challenges and projects, building on the initial understanding.

**Q4: Where will the ROE be hosted, what's its duration, and what will the format be like?**

**A4:** The ROE will be hosted on the TDS course portal, not the older Seek portal. It will be 45 minutes long. The format will be similar to our GA (Graded Activity) exercises: you'll have specific activities or tasks to complete, followed by a comment/detail box where you can enter your answers.

**Q5: Is the ROE an open-book exam? Can we collaborate or use the internet?**

**A5:** Yes, the ROE is explicitly an open-book exam. You can use the internet, browse any browser, refer to your playlists, and check your code blocks. Collaboration is encouraged on platforms like Discord. During the ROE, one of our instructors will also be available on a GMeet call to assist with any technical issues you might encounter.

**Q6: The 45-minute time limit for ROE seems insufficient, especially for complex questions. How should I approach this?**

**A6:** The ROE is designed to test your ability to efficiently manage your time and strategize. All questions are solvable and fall within the syllabus. The goal isn't necessarily to complete _every_ question, but to effectively solve scenarios under a time constraint. Think of it as "controlled chaos" – you know the time limit, and you need to form a strategy. It’s more about finding the most efficient path and adapting to slightly modified problems.

**Q7: What if I get stuck on a question or a particular tool during the ROE? What's the best strategy?**

**A7:** If you encounter a technical problem (e.g., the portal isn't loading, your answer isn't saving), immediately join the GMeet helpline, and an instructor will assist. For conceptual or tool-related issues, collaboration is key. You can use Discord or leverage the fact that it's open book/internet. A wise strategy is to identify your strengths and weaknesses. You could form a team where members specialize in different areas (e.g., one for web scraping, another for geospatial). If you're stuck, consider moving to the next question and come back later. Some prefer to tackle the hardest questions first ("eat the frog"), while others go for the easier ones ("low-hanging fruit"). Develop your own optimal strategy.

**Q8: There were supposed to be mock sessions, but some weren't fully completed. Will there be more mock sessions, and will you be solving mock questions today?**

**A8:** We’ve already conducted mock sessions last Thursday and Friday. There are additional sessions scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday) and Friday this week, which will cover remaining topics. No mock questions will be solved _today_. My advice is to go through the previously recorded mock session playlists, try to solve the questions yourself, and then bring any specific errors or difficulties you face to the upcoming live sessions. This way, we can effectively debug and course-correct.

**Q9: I noticed different ROE patterns for terms before September 24th and for September 24th/January 25th. Why the change, and which pattern will this term follow?**

**A9:** The format changes occurred primarily due to transitions in our learning platforms, not a fundamental shift in the ROE's core logic. Earlier ROEs were more like case studies, while recent ones are more aligned with the GA (Graded Activity) approach. The essence remains: you're given a dataset, and you answer questions based on it. This term will follow the pattern of the last two terms (Sept 24th/Jan 25th). While the format is consistent, the difficulty level might increase.

**Q10: The older ROEs were very difficult to complete within 45 minutes, but the newer ones felt easier. What's the expectation regarding difficulty and time management for this ROE?**

**A10:** The current ROE format is indeed more aligned with the GAs you've been doing. Our TAs and instructors ensure that all questions are solvable within the given time frame. The challenge isn't about raw knowledge, but efficient problem-solving and strategy. We check internally to ensure solvability and manageability. While you may have found older ROEs difficult, this one will be in a similar vein to the recent terms. The aim is to apply your skills quickly and adapt, not to feel overwhelmed.

**Q11: Will there be only one dataset for multiple questions, or multiple datasets? How many questions in total, and will they be randomized?**

**A11:** It won't be a single dataset for all questions. Similar to GAs, you'll likely encounter multiple distinct datasets, each accompanied by one or two related questions. We expect around 8 to 10 questions in total. Yes, both the questions and potentially the underlying datasets will be randomized for each student. Also, the dataset file sizes will generally be smaller compared to older ROEs, making them easier to handle.

**Q12: Is it sufficient to work on Google Colab, or do I need to use VS Code? Which tool is better?**

**A12:** I highly recommend using VS Code or another dedicated IDE (like Cursor or WinSurf) due to their extensive plugin support, especially for tasks involving database files. However, Colab should be sufficient for about 90% of the problems. While Colab is perfectly usable, having an IDE as a dedicated backup can be beneficial for specific scenarios. Most past ROEs could be completed entirely on Colab.

**Q13: When will the ROE link be shared?**

**A13:** The ROE link will be available exactly at 1:00 PM (on Sunday, July 20th). We will provide clear instructions on how to access it and any specific scenarios. If you have any trouble accessing the portal, immediately join the provided GMeet link, and an instructor will be there to assist you.

**Q14: Is ChatGPT/LLMs allowed, and will they be able to solve the ROE questions?**

**A14:** While the ROE is open internet and collaboration is allowed, the focus is on your problem-solving process and strategy, not solely on whether an LLM can provide a direct answer. LLMs are constantly refined, and questions are designed to require critical thinking and adaptation beyond simple query-and-response. We are not focusing on whether LLMs can bypass the system, but on ensuring you develop strong problem-solving skills.
