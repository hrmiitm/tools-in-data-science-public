Duration: 1h 58m

Here's an FAQ-style transcription of the tutorial:

**Q1: How do I link my academic status with GitHub Education?**

**A1:** You need to add your academic email (like your IIT Madras email) to your GitHub account. For proof of academic status, you'll need to upload a photo of your student ID card or an academic transcript. Make sure it's your latest ID card. When prompted, specify your expected degree completion year (e.g., 2027 or 2028). What you mention here, GitHub generally extends for you.

**Q2: What is the passing criteria for the course?**

**A2:** To pass the course, your total T-score needs to be greater than 40. This T-score is calculated using a specific formula that considers your scores from the best two out of five weekly graded assignments, Project 1, Project 2, ROE, and the final end-term exam. Each component has a different weightage. You can put your scores into an Excel sheet, multiply them by their respective weights, and sum them up to see what your T-score would be.

**Q3: My Project 1, Project 2, or ROE scores are low/zero. Can I still pass?**

**A3:** If you're struggling with some components, try to maximize your scores in others, especially Project 2 and the final end-term exam, as they often carry significant weight. You can use the T-score formula to understand how much you need to score in the remaining components to reach the passing threshold.

**Q4: I'm finding Project 2 difficult and have limited time before the deadline. What should I do?**

**A4:** The key is to be able to create solutions for the graded assignment questions using Python or other programming languages like Bash. If you're struggling to understand the concepts, focus on familiarizing yourself with the core logic required.

**Q5: How can I deploy my project effectively for evaluation?**

**A5:**

- **Digital Ocean:** This is a recommended option due to its ease of use. You can get $200 in credits by making a $5 prepayment (which you can later disable through PayPal). Digital Ocean also offers a CLI for managing your droplets.
- **AWS:** This is another viable option using EC2 instances. It involves setting up a Linux system, using command-line tools like `tmux` to run your Python program continuously in the background, and configuring SSL certificates for HTTPS. While it has a free tier, it can be more complex than Digital Ocean.
- **Other Platforms:** Vercel and Glitch were mentioned, with Glitch also offering free compute.

**Q6: What about setting up a custom domain for my deployed project?**

**A6:** You can use services like AWS Route 53, GoDaddy, or Hostinger. Hostinger, in particular, might offer cheaper `.in` or `.xyz` domains, especially with coupons. GitHub Developer Pack also provides free domains. When choosing a domain, ensure you know how to connect it to your hosting service.

**Q7: How important are DevTools in the data science industry?**

**A7:** DevTools are a crucial part of the data science industry. Having exposure and practical experience with these tools is highly valuable for securing jobs. The TDS course aims to provide this essential exposure.

**Q8: Where can I find resources to learn more about DevTools?**

**A8:** You can refer to the Week 1 live session recording and its associated FAQs for an initial overview. Beyond that, the internet (Google, YouTube) is your best resource for learning about specific tools and their functionalities. Practical application is key.

**Q9: Can I use the browser's "inspect element" console for debugging or interacting with my deployed application?**

**A9:** Yes, the browser's console is a powerful tool for debugging, testing commands, and interacting with web applications directly. You can access it through "inspect element" in your browser.
