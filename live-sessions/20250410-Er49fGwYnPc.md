Duration: 4792.0Here's an FAQ based on the live tutorial:

---

**Q1: What are bonus marks and how can I earn them?**

**A1:** If you _already_ completed GA7 (all submissions and 3 peer reviews by tomorrow's deadline), you have an opportunity to earn up to 5 bonus marks. You do this by completing 5 _additional_ peer reviews. Each review can earn you up to 1 bonus mark, which is added to your total T-score.

**Q2: Why is the course team offering bonus marks?**

**A2:** We believe learning should occur throughout the course. This initiative rewards students who stuck with GA7, demonstrating commitment and investment in the subject. It also benefits us by fostering collaboration and peer review, which are highly valued activities within the course. Your feedback helps us understand how to improve the course.

**Q3: I haven't completed all GA7 questions. How can I properly review other students' submissions?**

**A3:** The review form itself provides clear guidance on what's expected for each submission. Even if you haven't completed all the GA7 questions yourself, you can still review by looking at the provided submissions (like graphs or spreadsheets) from other students. Your evaluation should be fair based on their work, and if your score aligns with other reviewers, it indicates a good review. The process is also designed to encourage interaction, so if you have questions or can't access a submission, you can reach out to the peer you're reviewing; this engagement helps your own learning.

**Q4: Is it true that bonus marks are only for GA7, or is there an overall course bonus?**

**A4:** Bonus marks are tied to GA7 completion. If you have _not_ completed GA7 (including its required peer reviews), you are not eligible to attempt the bonus activities. These are _course_ bonus marks, separate from graded assignments, and can be added to your overall T-score. It's important to clarify that this is not a general course-wide bonus, but a specific opportunity for those who finished GA7.

**Q5: Are bonus marks mentioned in the official grading policy?**

**A5:** Yes, the grading policy document clarifies how bonus marks are awarded for additional activities, distinct from graded assignments. We strongly advise all students to read the grading policy document thoroughly. It's also mentioned that bonus activities _may be posted_ on Discourse.

**Q6: What is the course team's general philosophy regarding student support and course design?**

**A6:** We prioritize student interests and actively advocate for you, even when there's disagreement within the course team. Our goal is to promote continuous learning, critical thinking, and collaboration throughout the course. The course is designed to encourage this, and GA7, in particular, aims to integrate collaboration as a core part of the assessment process, justifying incentives for students who put in the effort to engage. We believe that by checking facts and using data, you can make informed judgments rather than relying on emotional arguments.

**Q7: When will the P2 results be released?**

**A7:** Due to unforeseen internal issues, there will be a delay in P2 results. The earliest possible release is Monday after your end-term exam. We will announce them as soon as we are able, and we assure you that your corrections will be added.

**Q8: Will the GA7 submission period be reopened for a day?**

**A8:** Unfortunately, no. Deadlines are important and cannot be reopened. We have pushed deadlines in the past due to unforeseen circumstances, but our intention is always to honor them. The GA7 submission period has closed.

**Q9: When will the mock exam be released, and what should I focus on for the end-term?**

**A9:** The mock exam will be released tomorrow, before the session starts. For end-term preparation, you should focus on the mock exam and revisit the key topics highlighted in the recent sessions. The end-term format will be similar to previous terms, including MCQs and scenario-based questions across all seven weeks, with emphasis on core concepts.

**Q10: I completed the GA7 form but didn't receive any confirmation email or information about the bonus. What should I do?**

**A10:** If you submitted your GA7 after the official deadline, you would not have received a confirmation email or bonus information. If you believe you submitted on time, please forward your confirmation email (which includes a timestamp) to me. Your correction will be processed, and your name will be added to the list for grading.

**Q11: Where should I send questions or issues to the course team?**

**A11:** Always use Discourse first. It allows multiple course team members and other students to see and respond, significantly increasing your chances of getting a quick and comprehensive answer. If you need to send an email for specific issues, avoid the official announcement mailbox (SC2002) as it's not monitored. Instead, email individual TAs or instructors directly.

**Q12: What is the overall value of marks in the context of this course and life in general?**

**A12:** While marks can seem important, especially for things like scholarships, they are not the sole determinant of success or personal value. The course team believes that learning and personal growth are more valuable. Don't let marks define you; focus on what you learn, how you can apply it, and what great things you can achieve. Life is much bigger than trivial scores. We encourage you to enjoy the learning journey, apply your knowledge to solve problems, and achieve success, even with seemingly simple innovations.

**Q13: Is the TDS team responsive to student feedback and concerns?**

**A13:** Yes, we are always listening and actively responsive. We advocate for students internally, even if you don't always see our efforts publicly. For instance, we fought for P1 re-evaluations for Docker files. Your feedback helps us continually improve the course, and we are dedicated to doing our best to support you and ensure you get the best possible outcome.

**Q14: What was discussed in today's session?**

**A14:** Today's session focused on clarifying various doubts and questions, particularly regarding bonus marks for GA7 completion, the release of P2 scores, the design of peer reviews, and the general philosophy of the course team in supporting students. We aim to ensure clarity on how you can collaborate and achieve success in the course.

**Q15: What is the final conclusion regarding bonus marks: If I didn't submit GA7, I won't get any bonus?**

**A15:** That is correct. If you did not complete GA7, you will not be eligible to attempt the bonus activities. Furthermore, even those who completed GA7 are not guaranteed bonus marks; it depends on the quality of their additional peer reviews and how they align with other reviewers' scores.

**Q16: I missed out on the bonus opportunity due to a misunderstanding regarding GA7 completion. What should I do?**

**A16:** We understand your frustration. Your correction for GA7 is being processed and will be pushed along with the end-term marks. We encourage you to send me the confirmation email you received when you submitted GA7, as that will have the timestamp needed to verify your submission. We did not know about the bonus ourselves until recently, and it was announced as an incentive for those who already completed GA7, even though it wasn't mandatory for core course completion.

**Q17: Will my ROE (Review of Evaluation) marks be added, and will the P1 solution be provided?**

**A17:** Your ROE marks, including the Docker file re-evaluation, are being processed and will be pushed along with your end-term marks. We have provided the P1 solution on Discourse.

**Q18: Will there be a session for the Project 1 solution?**

**A18:** We have already provided the solution on a Discourse post. The solution is designed to be Dockerized, so you'll need to use Docker to run it, even though you can try to tweak it for a local machine.

**Q19: What time is tomorrow's (the final) session?**

**A19:** Tomorrow's final session will be from 8 PM to 10 PM.
