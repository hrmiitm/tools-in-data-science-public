Here's an FAQ summary of the tutorial:

**Q1: How do I find the API URL in my browser's developer tools?**

**A1:** When interacting with a webpage (like typing in a search bar), if the page updates without a full reload, it's likely making an API call. To see these calls:

1.  Right-click on the webpage and select "Inspect" to open the developer tools.
2.  Go to the "Network" tab.
3.  Clear any existing network logs using the "Clear" button (a circle with a diagonal line).
4.  Perform the action on the webpage (e.g., type one character in a search bar) that triggers the dynamic update.
5.  You'll see new API calls appear in the Network tab. Click on a specific call by its name to view its details, including the "Headers" and "Response" tabs. The "Request URL" in the Headers tab is your API endpoint.

**Q2: How do I handle special characters like spaces and commas in the API URL parameters?**

**A2:** When you see parameters like `%2C` (for comma) or `%20` (for space) in the URL, this indicates URL encoding. To programmatically handle this, you'll need to replace these characters. For example, in Python, you can use `city_name.replace(" ", "%20")` and `city_name.replace(",", "%2C")` to ensure your search queries are correctly formatted for the API.

**Q3: The API response for Wikipedia is coming back as a text string (JSON-P) and not standard JSON. How do I extract the actual JSON data?**

**A3:** Sometimes, APIs return data wrapped in a function call (JSON-P) rather than pure JSON.

1.  Inspect the "Response" tab of the API call. You'll often see the JSON data wrapped within parentheses, potentially preceded by a function name (e.g., `callback_function(...)`).
2.  Identify the start and end of the actual JSON object within the text.
3.  In your code, you can use string manipulation (like `find()` and slicing) to extract this JSON string.
4.  Once you have the pure JSON string, you can use a JSON parser (like Python's `json.loads()`) to convert it into a usable data structure (e.g., a dictionary). For example, `json.loads(response_text[start_index:end_index])`.

**Q4: How can I search for a topic and get a summary from Wikipedia using its API?**

**A4:** The Wikipedia API provides methods for searching and retrieving summaries:

1.  **Search:** Use `wikipedia.search("Your Topic")` to find relevant pages and get a list of topic suggestions.
2.  **Summary:** Once you have a specific topic name (e.g., "List of cities by population in India"), you can use `wikipedia.summary("Your Topic", sentences=1)` to get a concise summary in a specified number of sentences.

**Q5: How do I extract specific information like images or tables from a Wikipedia page?**

**A5:** After getting a page object using `wikipedia.page("Your Topic")`:

1.  **Images:** The page object will have an `images` attribute which is a list of image URLs.
2.  **Tables:** Wikipedia pages are HTML. To extract tables, you typically need to fetch the full HTML content of the page (e.g., `page.html()`) and then use a web scraping library (like Beautiful Soup or Pandas' `read_html`) to parse the HTML and extract tables based on their structure. The `pandas.read_html()` function is particularly useful for this, as it can directly convert HTML tables into DataFrames.

**Q6: What about handling language preferences in API searches, for instance, getting results in Spanish?**

**A6:** Many APIs, including the Nominatim geocoding service, support specifying the language for results. You can often do this by adding a `lang` (or similar) parameter to your API request. For example, with Nominatim, you can include `lang='es'` for Spanish results in your API call. The Wikipedia library also supports this via `wikipedia.set_lang('es')`.

**Q7: How do I perform batch geocoding efficiently and respect API rate limits?**

**A7:** When geocoding multiple addresses:

1.  **Iterate:** Loop through your list of addresses.
2.  **Rate Limiting:** To avoid overwhelming the API and getting blocked, it's crucial to introduce a delay between requests. You can use `time.sleep(seconds)` within your loop. A common practice is to delay for at least 1 second per request, but this might vary depending on the API's specific rate limits.
3.  **Error Handling:** Implement `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle cases where an address might not be found or an API call fails.
4.  **Store Results:** Create new columns in your DataFrame (e.g., 'latitude', 'longitude') to store the geocoded results for each address.
5.  **Null Value Handling:** When extracting latitude/longitude from the API response, always check if the location object is `None` (no result found) before attempting to access its attributes. If it's `None`, assign `None` or a placeholder value to your DataFrame columns.

**Q8: How do I integrate geocoding results into a Pandas DataFrame?**

**A8:** You can add new columns to your DataFrame by applying a geocoding function:

1.  Define a function that takes an address (or a row from your DataFrame) and returns the desired geocoded information (e.g., latitude, longitude).
2.  Use the `DataFrame.apply()` method to apply this function to your address column. For example: `df['latitude'] = df['address_column'].apply(lambda addr: get_lat(addr))`.
3.  Ensure your geocoding function handles `None` results gracefully (as mentioned in Q7) so that failed lookups don't crash your script and result in `None` or other suitable markers in your DataFrame.

**Q9: The code in my Google Colab notebook looks messy with very long lines. How can I make it more readable?**

**A9:** Google Colab has a built-in feature for code wrapping:

1.  Go to **Tools > Settings**.
2.  Navigate to the **Editor** tab.
3.  Check the "Enable code wrapping" option. This will wrap long lines within your editor window, improving readability without changing the actual code.
