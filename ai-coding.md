# AI Coding

AI-assisted development pairs human judgment with generative models across every workspace. This module shows how to set up productive collaborations, feed models the right project context, and ship code you trust.

You'll explore:

- **Creative prompting** that shapes tone and flow through vibe coding sessions and scenario planning.
- **Environment-specific tooling** for working in browser editors, IDE extensions, and CLI companions without losing momentum.
- **Context engineering practices** that stage repositories, snippets, and docs so models stay grounded in your codebase.
- **Quality safeguards** that weave in automated tests, structured reviews, and targeted tool calls to keep AI-written code production ready.

By the end you will know when to lean on AI, how to steer it with precise context, and the guardrails that turn generated snippets into maintainable features.
