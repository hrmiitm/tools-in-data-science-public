### Basic workflow

**Copy your code and context**: Select the problematic code, relevant error messages, and any necessary surrounding context. Include file names, function purposes, and specific requirements in your copy.

**Paste into AI chat**: Use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [Qwen](https://chat.qwen.ai/), [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/), or similar web interfaces. Be specific about what you want: "Fix this bug", "Optimize this function", "Add error handling", etc.

**Review and paste back**: Carefully review the AI's suggestions before pasting back into your editor. AI responses may not account for your full codebase context.

### Essential safety practices

**Always run linters and tests**: After pasting AI-generated code, immediately run your linters, type checkers, and test suites. This catches syntax errors, type mismatches, and broken functionality.

**Avoid context drift**: AI assistants don't remember your full codebase. Include relevant imports, type definitions, and function signatures when asking for help with complex code.

**Version control everything**: Commit your working code before applying AI suggestions. This gives you an easy rollback path if the AI changes break something unexpected.

### Best use cases

- **Quick bug fixes**: Copy error messages and the surrounding code for fast debugging
- **Code refactoring**: Get suggestions for cleaner, more efficient implementations
- **Documentation**: Generate comments and docstrings for existing functions
- **Learning new patterns**: Understand unfamiliar code by asking for explanations

## GitHub Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) is the most widely adopted AI coding assistant, seamlessly integrated into VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and other popular editors. It provides real-time code suggestions and has evolved into a comprehensive AI development platform.

Copilot uses OpenAI's models trained specifically on code repositories, making it exceptionally good at understanding programming patterns and suggesting contextually relevant completions.

[![Get Started with GitHub Copilot in VS Code (2025)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/vdBxfFVXnc0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/vdBxfFVXnc0)

### Key features

**Ghost text completions**: As you type, Copilot suggests code completions in gray text. Press `Tab` to accept the full suggestion, or `Ctrl+→` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+→` (Mac) to accept word by word.

**Inline chat (`Ctrl+I`)**: Ask Copilot to generate or modify code directly in your editor. This is perfect for writing new functions or refactoring existing code with natural language instructions.

**Chat panel**: Open a dedicated chat interface to discuss your code, ask questions, and get explanations. Access with `Ctrl+Shift+I` or the Copilot icon in the activity bar.

**Code actions**: Right-click on selected code to access Copilot-powered actions like "Explain this", "Generate tests", or "Fix with Copilot".

### Tips and tricks

**Use descriptive variable names**: Copilot uses variable and function names as context clues. `user_data` will get better suggestions than `data`.

**Write clear comments**: Start functions with comments describing what they should do. Copilot often generates complete implementations from good comments.

**Accept suggestions incrementally**: Use `Ctrl+→` to accept partial suggestions instead of the full completion. This gives you more control over the generated code.

**Toggle Copilot strategically**: Click the Copilot icon in the status bar to disable it for specific files or languages where you want to practice coding without assistance.

**Leverage the command palette**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search "Copilot" to access all available commands, including explain code, generate tests, and suggest improvements.

## Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.com/) is an AI-native code editor built specifically for AI-powered development. It combines the familiar VS Code interface with advanced AI capabilities, offering superior context understanding and multi-file editing.

Cursor differentiates itself through proprietary models trained specifically for code editing and its ability to understand entire codebases, not just individual files.

[![Cursor Tutorial for Beginners (AI Code Editor)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/ocMOZpuAMw4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/ocMOZpuAMw4)

### Key features

**Tab autocomplete**: Powered by proprietary models that predict multi-line edits and can suggest changes across multiple files simultaneously. More advanced than traditional autocomplete.

**Composer (Agent mode `Ctrl+I`)**: An AI agent that can make complex, multi-file changes end-to-end. It finds relevant files, applies changes, and can even run terminal commands with your approval.

**Chat with codebase (`@` mentions)**: Reference specific files, functions, or code symbols using `@` syntax. This gives the AI precise context about your codebase structure.

**Image support**: Drag images into the chat to include visual context. Useful for implementing UI designs or debugging visual issues.

**Web search (`@Web`)**: Get up-to-date information from the internet. Helpful for finding current API documentation or solving recent technology issues.

### Advanced capabilities

**Smart rewrites**: Type carelessly and Cursor fixes your mistakes automatically, understanding intent even from rough input.

**Multi-file context**: Cursor can understand relationships between files and suggest changes that maintain consistency across your entire project.

**Terminal integration (`Ctrl+K` in terminal)**: Write terminal commands in plain English and Cursor converts them to the appropriate shell commands.

**Error detection and fixes**: Automatically detects lint errors and applies fixes, reducing manual debugging time.

### Tips and tricks

**Use precise `@` references**: Instead of explaining context, use `@filename` or `@function_name` to give Cursor exact context about what you're working with.

**Leverage Tab navigation**: Press `Tab` to jump through multi-line suggestions, allowing you to accept parts of complex changes incrementally.

**Customize instructions**: Set up project-specific instructions to teach Cursor about your coding style, frameworks, and conventions.

**Trust but verify**: Cursor's agent mode is powerful but always review changes before accepting them, especially in production code.
